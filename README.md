- Use XAMPP Server for Database Connection.


### DESCRIPTION
There is a need to develop a Database Management System for maintaining the Payroll
of ABC Organization. ​ ABC needs a system which allows the employees to have their
information available on their online portals. The system generates their Net Income
based on the deductions, allowances and leaves.

The ​ Employees​ will have their basic details such as their names, designations, contact
number and date of joining on their Portal. Every Employee will be given a User ID and
Password which will be used to access their account information. New designations can
also be added. The ​ Salary​ of the employees will be defined according to their
Designations. Components like DA, HRA, Medical Allowances and Arrears will be added
and Charges of Hostel/Bus and Welfare Funds will be deducted from the Gross Income
to generate the Net Income of the Employee. The information related to the ​ Leaves
taken by the employees will contain Type of Leave, No. of Days, Start Date, End Date and
the Reason.

Every employee will be paid based on their designations. There will be deductions from
the salary based on the Leaves of each employee. The ​ Administrator​ will be able to add
new employees, remove employees, and change personal information about employees.
The administrator will have additional reporting capabilities beyond that of an employee,
which include various administrative reports yet to be identified.
